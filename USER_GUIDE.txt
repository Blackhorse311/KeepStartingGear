================================================================================
                 SECTION 1: WHAT THIS MOD DOES (AND DOESN'T DO)
================================================================================

  WHAT IT DOES:
  -------------

  * Saves your gear when you START a raid
  * Restores that saved gear if you DIE
  * Lets you keep loot if you successfully EXTRACT

  That's it. That's the whole mod.


  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
  --------------------

  * It does NOT duplicate items
  * It does NOT give you infinite gear
  * It does NOT protect items you pick up during the raid
  * It does NOT work in multiplayer/Fika
  * It does NOT prevent the death from happening - you still die


  THE SIMPLE VERSION:
  -------------------

  Think of it like this:

     1. You enter a raid with a rifle, armor, and backpack
     2. The mod takes a "photo" of your gear (called a snapshot)
     3. You find some cool loot and put it in your backpack
     4. You get killed by a scav
     5. The mod "restores" your gear to what it was in the photo
     6. Your rifle, armor, and backpack come back
     7. The loot you found? GONE. It wasn't in the original photo.

  If you EXTRACT instead of dying:

     1. Your snapshot is deleted
     2. You keep everything - your starting gear AND your loot
     3. The mod does nothing else


  THE KEY THING TO UNDERSTAND:
  ----------------------------

  This mod protects what you BRING INTO the raid.
  It does NOT protect what you FIND IN the raid.

  If you die, you get back what you started with.
  If you extract, you keep everything.

================================================================================
                   SECTION 2: INSTALLATION - READ THIS FIRST
================================================================================

  REQUIREMENTS:
  -------------

  * SPT 4.0.x (tested on 4.0.11)
  * That's it. No other mods required.


  INSTALLATION STEPS:
  -------------------

  Step 1: CLOSE EVERYTHING
          - Close SPT Server (the command prompt window)
          - Close the game if it's running
          - Seriously, close them both

  Step 2: FIND YOUR SPT FOLDER
          - This is the folder where "SPT.Server.exe" lives
          - Usually something like C:\SPT or D:\Games\SPT
          - If you don't know where this is, you need to find it first

  Step 3: EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE
          - Right-click the downloaded zip file
          - Choose "Extract All" or use 7-Zip/WinRAR
          - Extract it DIRECTLY into your SPT folder
          - When asked about merging folders, say YES

  Step 4: VERIFY INSTALLATION
          - You should now have these files:

          [Your SPT Folder]/
          |
          +-- BepInEx/
          |   +-- plugins/
          |       +-- Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/
          |           +-- Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.dll  <-- CLIENT MOD
          |
          +-- SPT/
          |   +-- user/
          |       +-- mods/
          |           +-- Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/
          |               +-- Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.Server.dll  <-- SERVER MOD
          |
          +-- SPT.Server.exe

  Step 5: START THE GAME
          - Start SPT.Server.exe first
          - Wait for the server console to say it's ready
          - Then start the game launcher
          - Play!


  COMMON INSTALLATION MISTAKES:
  -----------------------------

  WRONG: Extracting into a subfolder
         Example: C:\SPT\KeepStartingGear\BepInEx\...

         You should NOT have a "KeepStartingGear" folder in your SPT root.
         The BepInEx and SPT folders should merge with the existing ones.

  WRONG: Only installing one part
         This mod has TWO parts - client AND server.
         If you only have ONE of the DLL files, it won't work.

  WRONG: Installing while the game is running
         Always close the server and game first.

================================================================================
                    SECTION 3: YOUR FIRST RAID WITH THIS MOD
================================================================================

  DEFAULT BEHAVIOR (NO SETUP NEEDED):
  -----------------------------------

  The mod works immediately after installation with these defaults:

  1. ENTER A RAID
     - You'll see a green notification: "Auto-Snapshot Saved"
     - This means your gear has been saved

  2. PLAY THE RAID
     - Loot stuff, fight scavs, do whatever
     - The mod is just watching

  3. IF YOU DIE
     - Your gear is automatically restored
     - You get back exactly what you started with
     - No "Run-Through" penalty, no exploits

  4. IF YOU EXTRACT
     - Your snapshot is cleared
     - You keep everything you have
     - The mod does nothing


  WHAT THE NOTIFICATIONS MEAN:
  ----------------------------

  "Auto-Snapshot Saved"
     = Your gear was successfully saved. Good to go.

  "Gear Restored"
     = You died and your starting gear was put back in your inventory.

  "Snapshot Cleared"
     = You extracted successfully. The snapshot was deleted.


  IF YOU DON'T SEE NOTIFICATIONS:
  -------------------------------

  That's okay! The mod still works. Some people prefer no notifications.
  You can turn them on in the settings (see Section 4).

================================================================================
                      SECTION 5: COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

  Q: Do I need to do anything for this mod to work?
  A: No. Just install it and play. It works automatically.

  Q: Will I get banned for using this?
  A: No. SPT is single-player offline. There's no one to ban you.

  Q: Does this work with other mods?
  A: Yes, mostly. See the exceptions below.

  Q: Does this work with SVM (Server Value Modifier)?
  A: Yes, BUT you must disable these SVM settings:
     - Safe Exit = OFF
     - Softcore Mode = OFF
     If you don't, you'll have problems.

  Q: Does this work with Fika (multiplayer)?
  A: No. This is a single-player only mod.

  Q: Does this duplicate items?
  A: No. When you die, you get BACK what you started with.
     Items you found during the raid are lost.

  Q: What about the items in my secure container?
  A: They're protected too, by default. You can turn this off in settings.

  Q: What if I pick up better gear during a raid and die?
  A: You get your ORIGINAL gear back, not the better gear you picked up.
     The snapshot is from raid START, not raid END.

  Q: Can I update my snapshot mid-raid?
  A: Yes, if you use "Auto + Manual" or "Manual Only" mode.
     Press Ctrl+Alt+F8 to save your current gear.

  Q: Does the mod affect my stash?
  A: No. It only deals with gear you take INTO raids.

  Q: What about durability, ammo, medical items?
  A: Everything is restored exactly as it was:
     - Gun durability
     - Ammo counts in magazines
     - Medical item charges
     - Armor plate durability

  Q: I died but my gear wasn't restored. What happened?
  A: Check:
     - Both mods installed? (client AND server)
     - Using SVM? (disable Safe Exit and Softcore Mode)
     - Server console for errors

  Q: Can I use this to farm items?
  A: No. You only get back what you started with. Nothing new.

                    SECTION 6: WHEN THINGS GO WRONG
================================================================================

  PROBLEM: Mod doesn't seem to do anything
  -----------------------------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. Check both files are installed:
     - BepInEx/plugins/Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.dll
     - SPT/user/mods/Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.Server.dll
  2. Check the server console for errors when starting
  3. Check BepInEx/LogOutput.log for errors


  PROBLEM: "Auto-Snapshot Saved" notification doesn't appear
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. Notifications might be turned off - check F12 settings
  2. The mod might still be working - try dying to see if gear restores


  PROBLEM: Gear not restoring after death
  ---------------------------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. Make sure you're dying, not disconnecting
  2. Check if you're using SVM - disable Safe Exit and Softcore Mode
  3. Check server console for error messages
  4. Try a fresh raid


  PROBLEM: Items are disappearing
  -------------------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. This shouldn't happen with this mod
  2. If it does, another mod might be conflicting
  3. Report the issue with your log files


  PROBLEM: Duplicate items appearing
  ----------------------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. This can happen if SVM's "Save Gear After Death" is enabled
  2. Disable that SVM setting
  3. If you're not using SVM, report the issue


  PROBLEM: Game crashes
  ---------------------
  SOLUTION:
  1. Check BepInEx/LogOutput.log for error messages
  2. Try disabling other mods to find conflicts
  3. Report the issue with your log file


  HOW TO REPORT A BUG:
  --------------------

  Go to: https://github.com/Blackhorse311/KeepStartingGear/issues

  Include:
  1. What you expected to happen
  2. What actually happened
  3. Your SPT version
  4. Your BepInEx/LogOutput.log file
  5. Any other mods you're using

  VERSION 2.0.0 - HUMAN + AI COLLABORATION:
  -----------------------------------------
  Version 2.0.0 was developed through a collaboration between Blackhorse311
  and Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. This collaboration
  represents a new approach to mod development:

  - Blackhorse311 provided the creative vision, feature requirements, and
    testing expertise that comes from being an active SPT player

  - Claude assisted with code implementation, architecture design, code
    review, documentation, and quality assurance

  Together, we implemented:
  - 7 new major features (UI overlays, themes, profiles, statistics)
  - 26 bug fixes identified through comprehensive code review
  - Improved thread safety and security hardening
  - Complete documentation overhaul

  This version demonstrates that human creativity combined with AI
  capabilities can produce something greater than either could alone.
