KEEP STARTING GEAR v1.4.1 - INSTALLATION GUIDE
================================================================================

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- SPT 4.0.x (tested on 4.0.8)
- BepInEx 5.x (included with SPT)

No additional dependencies required.


INSTALLATION (3 Simple Steps)
-----------------------------

Step 1: Close SPT
   - Make sure SPT Server and the game are not running

Step 2: Extract Files
   - Extract this archive directly into your SPT root folder
   - This is the folder where SPT.Server.exe is located
   - When prompted, choose to merge/overwrite folders

Step 3: Verify Installation
   - You should now have these files:

   [Your SPT Folder]/
   ├── BepInEx/
   │   └── plugins/
   │       └── Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/
   │           └── Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.dll    <-- Client mod
   └── user/
       └── mods/
           └── Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/
               └── Blackhorse311.KeepStartingGear.Server.dll    <-- Server mod

That's it! Start SPT Server, then launch the game.


QUICK START GUIDE
-----------------

Default Behavior (no configuration needed):
1. Start a raid - your gear is automatically saved
2. You'll see a green notification: "Auto-Snapshot Saved"
3. If you die, your gear is automatically restored
4. If you extract successfully, the snapshot is cleared

Configuration (optional):
- Press F12 in-game to open the BepInEx Configuration Manager
- Find "Keep Starting Gear" in the list
- Adjust settings as desired (snapshot mode, keybind, slot protection, etc.)


CONFIGURATION PRESETS
---------------------

Casual (Default):
- Automatic snapshots at raid start
- All gear protected
- No manual intervention needed

Hardcore:
- Manual snapshots only (press Ctrl+Alt+F8)
- Found-in-Raid items excluded
- Insured items excluded


UNINSTALLATION
--------------

Step 1: Delete the client mod folder:
   BepInEx/plugins/Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/

Step 2: Delete the server mod folder:
   user/mods/Blackhorse311-KeepStartingGear/

Step 3 (optional): Delete the config file:
   BepInEx/config/com.blackhorse311.keepstartinggear.cfg


TROUBLESHOOTING
